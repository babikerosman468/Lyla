git commit -m "Remove nn"


---

After that, finish syncing your local and remote branches:

git pull origin main

ðŸ‘‰ If thereâ€™s a merge conflict, resolve it.

Finally:

git push origin main


---

Once youâ€™ve done this, nn will be gone from your repo and remote!
If youâ€™d like, share your git status again after commit and pull â€” Iâ€™ll help you finish it cleanly. ðŸš€










âœ… Good â€” your nn deletion is committed!
Now your git pull stopped because your local and remote branches diverged, and Git wants you to choose how to reconcile them (merge or rebase).


---

ðŸ“Œ What this means

You must tell Git how to combine:

Your local commit(s): "Remove nn" and your other local work.

The remoteâ€™s new commit(s): whatâ€™s already on origin/main.



---

âœ… The quick fix: use merge

Just run:

git pull --no-rebase origin main

or:

git pull --no-rebase

This will merge the remote main into your local main.
If thereâ€™s a conflict, Git will say so â€” youâ€™ll resolve it, stage, and commit.


---

âœ… If you want to always merge by default:

git config pull.rebase false


---

âœ… Then finish:

After the pull merge succeeds:

git push origin main


---

Summary:

git pull --no-rebase â†’ merge way

git pull --rebase â†’ rebase way (cleaner history, sometimes more confusing)

git pull --ff-only â†’ only if branches didnâ€™t diverge



---

Run:

git pull --no-rebase origin main

and let me know what it says â€” Iâ€™ll guide you if thereâ€™s a conflict! ðŸš¦âœ¨
