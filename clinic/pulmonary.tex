\section*{Introduction}
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. It is primarily caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke. COPD is a progressive condition, meaning it typically worsens over time. It encompasses two main conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chronic bronchitis:} Characterized by inflammation of the bronchial tubes and excessive mucus production.
    \item \textbf{Emphysema:} Involves the destruction of the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs, reducing the surface area for gas exchange.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Symptoms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Persistent cough (often with mucus)
    \item Shortness of breath, especially during physical activity
    \item Wheezing
    \item Chest tightness
    \item Frequent respiratory infections
    \item Fatigue
    \item Cyanosis (blue lips or fingernail beds in severe cases)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Risk Factors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Smoking (the leading cause)
    \item Exposure to secondhand smoke
    \item Long-term exposure to air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust
    \item Genetic predisposition, such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
    \item Age (more common in people over 40)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Diagnosis}
COPD is diagnosed through:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spirometry:} A lung function test to measure airflow.
    \item \textbf{Imaging tests:} Chest X-rays or CT scans to check for emphysema.
    \item \textbf{Blood tests:} To measure oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.
    \item \textbf{Alpha-1 antitrypsin testing:} For genetic testing in younger patients.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Management and Treatment}
\subsection*{1. Lifestyle Changes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quit smoking immediately.
    \item Avoid lung irritants (e.g., pollution, dust).
    \item Engage in pulmonary rehabilitation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Medications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bronchodilators:} To relax airway muscles (e.g., albuterol, salmeterol).
    \item \textbf{Corticosteroids:} To reduce inflammation.
    \item \textbf{Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors:} For severe COPD to decrease inflammation.
    \item \textbf{Oxygen therapy:} For advanced stages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Surgical Options}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lung volume reduction surgery:} Removal of damaged lung tissue.
    \item \textbf{Lung transplant:} For end-stage COPD.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Vaccination}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flu and pneumococcal vaccines to prevent infections.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{5. Diet and Exercise}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maintain a balanced diet to prevent weight loss or gain.
    \item Engage in mild exercise to improve stamina under professional guidance.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Prognosis}
COPD is a chronic and incurable disease, but early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can significantly improve quality of life and slow disease progression.
