\section*{Summary}
Lipomas are common benign tumors made of fatty tissue, typically appearing on the upper arms, thighs, or torso. They are soft, slow-growing, and usually painless. While the exact cause is unknown, factors like genetics, age, trauma, and certain genetic syndromes (e.g., Gardnerâ€™s Syndrome) may contribute. Diagnosis is often clinical but may involve imaging or biopsy to exclude malignancy. Treatment is not always necessary unless the lipoma causes discomfort, grows, or raises cosmetic concerns; options include surgical excision, liposuction, or steroid injections. Medical attention is advised if the lipoma changes rapidly, becomes painful, or shows signs of infection.
